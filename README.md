# Connect4
This repositary stores a connect 4 playing engine that I built using C++.
The engine uses minimax algorithm going to a depth of 5 moves down the game tree. It uses static value allocation at the lowest level in the game tree, based on rating the board for wins, traps and blockers. The graphics are implemented using a simple graphics library: simplecpp. The player plays using a prompt.
